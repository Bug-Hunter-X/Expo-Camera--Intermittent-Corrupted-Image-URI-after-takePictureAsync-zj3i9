This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom image processing.  After taking a picture, the `photo` object returned by `takePictureAsync` sometimes contains an unexpected or corrupted `uri` property. This results in an inability to display or process the image properly. The error isn't consistent; it happens intermittently, making debugging difficult.  The image preview often shows correctly before the `uri` becomes corrupted. The issue seems linked to memory management or asynchronous operations within Expo's Camera component, especially when dealing with larger images or intensive image manipulation tasks.
